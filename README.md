# Deep Space Surface Habitat Unit Pack

Inspired by NASA's ground-based Deep Space Habitat Demonstration Unit. 


Installation:

Extract the contents of the GameData folder into your Kerbal GameData directory. Structure should then read GameData\DSSHU

Optional compatibility patches:

Extract the desired patches from the "Optional Patches" folder into your GameData\DSSHU folder.

IMPORTANT: Only choose ONE life support mod patch if you choose any. Multiple will likely cause unwanted and problematic results.



There are no dependencies for this mod, but if you choose to use any of the included optional compatibility configurations, you will need to also install module manager.

There are no wheels on the bottoms of these units, so connecting them may end up being your least favorite part of these habitats. They have plenty of collision meshes, so you should have no problem using something like Konstruction with a forklift and shimmying the buildings into place. Alternatively, you may use something like VesselMover and simply position the building into place and it will dock accordingly.

Please do not keep anything attached to the upper or lower nodes when you "Deploy" it. It will explode. I have not added plugin compatibility for moving a connected node while animated.
